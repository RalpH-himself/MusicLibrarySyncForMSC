MusicLibrarySyncForMSC
======================

This script can be used to copy all of a part of your music library to a Mass Storage Device (USB stick/HDD, MSC-compatible MP3 players/smartphones, ...). It works with every player that can export its library as iTunes-compatible XML database (i.e. Winamp 5.5). If there is not sufficient space available, copying starts with the highest rated songs. Your M3U-playlists are also copied, with omitted songs removed from them.
